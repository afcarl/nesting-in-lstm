mobile just destroyed our co located brainstorming exercise xD or extend it?
Keiner hat an Ihrem Videoanruf teilgenommen.2. Okt., 15:05

@ofra: having lunch? does that inspire you for an idea for mobile ideamap?
Was just at a talk and going to lunch, talk to you later :-)

#whiteboard. summary brainstorming session
sorry I missed your session!
looks fun!
haha
But actually, we want to look at how people generate ideas together through conversation on mobile application
so we try it on ourselves with G Hangout.
oh, so the two of you were in different places?
it is an ongoing process that probably span a weekend.
cool, feel free to try to hook me in again at some point
tomorrow I'll be hiking mostly
Fun!
but sunday probably around
yeah, going hiking with your academic uncle and his sister
sunday I'm meeting katharina late afternoon
will do
what are you up to?
writing an abstract for my talk.
oh, how was the practice talk??
I was a sleep but not because it was boring 
well horrible as expected
haha
I'm sure it wasn't horrible
#offtopicdiscussion Is an offtopic discussion in an ideation chat leads to a better and diverse idea set? :-)
sorry bad grammar :-P
I think it can
let's see 
#offtpicdiscussion might help strengthen social bond?
I think social bond, possibly give time to incubate
and sometimes create remote connecitons
oops typo #offtopicdiscussion
like creative connections

#beer working on my creativity
#offtopic one of you has to change your profile pic
it's very confusing!
#socialActivity how do ideas emerge in socializing activity?
#? what does it mean when you put a question mark at the end of your thought? I can be a question, suggestion or anything.
#branching. How do we handle parallel threads of conversation that is ongoing right now?
I actually had a research idea related to your last  question for a long time
on whatsapp, hipchate, slack
can we automatically separate different threads of conversation
to create meaningful summaries or to point people to message they are likely to be interested in
Ohhh that would be cool
I plan to work on that some time in the next 3 years 
it seems like designing an interface for this would be fun too
yup
we can make it a shared project 
anyway, I should go back to brainstorming ideas for my internship project..
will follow your thread later!
okie
good luck!
oh, what's the deal with tiger and lion?
thx
Lion all the way
i meant
Tiger
sorry

#beer it works...Im thinking creatively now :-D
@ofra how does #branching relate to #offtopic?
@pao plz text after aikido what research question comes to your mind
Bernd hat den Hangout umbenannt in Ideahound.
well, if you're #branching #offtopic? 
#branching seems to be #offtopic
#? :-)
I think #branching doesn't have to be #offtopic (it could just be expanding the space of ideas), but #offtopic might help you branch?
#idea lets remove #offtopic...how do we know in advance
know what in advance?
whether it will be offtopic or not
oh I see
#? how does your weekend plan relate to your brainstorming session?
#answer not really, but possibly
I'll go hiking
for which I will be driving
so perhaps I'll have ideas
as the project is motivated by self-driving cars to some extent
#idea lets just analyze gchat for ideahound, I like it quite alot ;-)
agree, it's cool

#idea after waking up we could ask ppl for one microtask. like for example whats the relationship between idea1,2,3. my hypothesis is that because this reminds them on previous ideas, they might have more ideas

whoa i can even draw here
I like the morning idea
and #elaborate maybe also good to look at ideas right before you go to sleep so you think about them?
#keepingTrack  I also found out hard to keep track of previous ideas. So maybe there's a way we can archive the ideas for easy access somehow.
yes, I think that would be helpful... if you use the idea hashtag that should not be too hard(?)
@keepingTrack agree, there should be a list or something.
@keepingTrack the good thing though is you dont get fixated. so ideas might be double but from different angles. but there should be also a convergence mechanism
#diversifyToElaborate if our ideamap has enough "core branches", we switch to elaboration mode and show the idea list. but when is it "enough"
#agent what about including a context aware agent in the discussion. like now I am bored because I dont get any response then the AI could jump in
#offtopic its impossible to mine a hangout chat lol google wtf #$!?
#hypothesis a distributed ideation tool such as a chat interface leads toeards creating more diverse ideas because I dont remember all the previous ideas
#monologueEnd

I found a good source for hiking information around seattle from a hippie former student at UW: http://www.gajos.org/travel/nearSeattle/ (see if you can recognize this person!)
hmm, I guess the link reveals the answer
wow I barely recognized him

...engaged in some mysterious activity on top of Mt. Dickerman
I like the caption :D
yeah, that one is funny
wow thats interesting
I found a karaoke photo of him
what??
http://gajos.org/cgi-bin/photomgr/annotate.pl?action=showOne&loc=/travel/china1999/slides/KARAOKE-lg.jpg&template=/templates/singleBlack.tmpl&seriesLoc=/travel/china1999/xyz.shw
#fillingInTheBlank leave some part of old ideas unfinished
oh man
don't tell him you found that
he will be bummed and take down the webpage
Hahaha
oh thats true, luckily we didnt add him to this chat
You can distribute it as a secret link
hey I have an idea, lets ask him to go to Karaoke sometime
maybe better not to distribute it..
I think he won't like it
but we can try to get him to kareoke
#yourProfessors a websites that collect professors'embarrassing photos
hahaha
#yourProfessors excellent idea
did you see the pics from 1992?????
http://gajos.org/cgi-bin/photomgr/annotate.pl?action=showOne&loc=/travel/CuttySark/cuttySark1-med.jpg&template=/templates/singleWhite.tmpl&seriesLoc=/travel/CuttySark/CuttySark.shw

so young!!
Whoa
alright
that was fun
now back to more productive activiites 
#badGuy 
#badGuy is me
#badGuy, we can have an agent that does this job (pulling people back to serious) in the conversation.
And use Ofra's photo as its avatar
like!
(with permission of course)
#symposium would be fun if you guys come to the AAAI symposium on teamwork that we're organizing. The ideahound stuff is actually very much related! you can ask K to see what he thinks... But the submission deadline is on Friday
projects.iq.harvard.edu/teamwork-symposium
http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/teamwork-symposium
#pao, more specifically, a short paper along the lines of your UIST DC submission will be appropriate
#summary so the overall task is to integrate mobile into the ideation task. the setting is a group of people (>2). there are two main questions, (1) how to improve ideahound by integrating mobile interaction (such as microtasks, unstructured text), especially when do people prefer which type of ideation methodology (whiteboard,PC,mobile) (2) how can we leverage context (eg. social context that everybody is always available for the ideation task, also good for incubation?, location/activity-on-phone/affect) in such a mobile application and how is the phone's capability of measuring context relevant for such a mobile creativity tool. Are there any other advantages of mobile that we miss here? 
sounds cool, I anyway wanted to go there. Lets make K like it :-)
#fastIterationIsGoodAndBad
#idea could you utilize something like wait learning for ideation? https://groups.csail.mit.edu/uid/other-pubs/chi2014-cjcai-waitlearning-wip.pdf
yup
or Twitch #microtasksDuringPhoneUnlock
also #mobileKeyboardSucks so speech could potentially be of use^^
#alarmClock? what if in order to turn off your alarm in the morning you have to come up with an idea?
#alarmClock what if the alarm clock is triggered if someone else has a great idea 

#teamMeetup if the idea converges, a doodle is automatically triggered to schedule a group meeting
like #teamMeetup
#offtopic maybe we should include parts of this chat in the AAAI proposal (after removing the #offtopics )
like!
(when we wrote with sebastian the collaborative writing work-in-progress we included pictures from the google doc that we used for writing the pape r:))
like!
I'm also writing at the moment a grant proposal for funding travel grants to students for the symposium so hopefully it won't be too expensive for K to send you... If you come we can all take an AirBnB together 
#summary so we have all these unstructured ideas, ideahound and microtasks is definitely needed to structure all this^^
indeed!
that'd be great
is there also some funding to travel to you over the weekend for a hike in Seattle this fall ? 

haha, no funding that I know of but you can count on a place to stay and a car to take you places!!
you should totally come, it's so nice here
but seriously, that'd be great I hope we ge tthe grant
we probably won't know until after registration, so can't count on it too much
i checked the flight is 600$ :'-(
what about the other Healthcare grant btw? 
are there any news?
still waiting to hear "any week now" they told barbara last time
hmmm
too slowww~
yup..
flight to seattle or to stanford?
I found flights to stanford for march in 360
Seattle
ah, that's expensive!
i knoww!!
I see flights to seattle for 300
thus-sun
oct 22
wait, but when do you go to uist?
good question
nov 8-11
hm...Pao wou,d 
uist is in north carolina?
yep
too bad it's not in seattle
wow i found a direct fight for 320 usd that weekend
the w/e before or after uist?
oct 22
so two weeks before
ah yea
if it works out for you it can be a lot of fun
there's also thanks giving late,r but flights will probably be expensive then
(are we corrupting ideahound thread? oops. though if we spend a weekend hiking I bet we'll have ideas )
no because Ideahound goes mobile

and my theory is mobile ideahound enables exactly these offtopic discussions so people have an overall better social connection. there are some papers that show exactly this 
ooh, sounds good to me 
another #offtopic #pao -- how's preparation for your talk? if you want a remote practice you can try it on me!
and Bernd, I'm totally serious that you should come visit me! your gf too if she's already in the us. Pao also welcome but I know you already have a lot of travel (maybe it fits in the couple of days between stuff??)
@pao but you dont come to uist right? is there another conference you gonna attend this fall?
she's going to uist
she's in the doctorla consortium
ahhh sorry I mixed that up with CHI, rightt....
if you can fly here for 300 it's a pretty good deal. cause you don't need accommodation, and we can just take the car and go explore
I like #alarmClock
#paocatchingup
and then the thread gets so long that I am too lazy to read it
- -"
#opportunityfortechnologysupport
#quickView gives you a quick view of the conversation while you are away
and then you also need my automatic detection of threads in a conversation to create meaningful summaries 
@Pao what are you travel plans? #offtopic #summary
For what?
this fall
for visiting seattle you had some "dead" days between reunion and uist?
though I guess if you already booked the flights it's more tricky
I am away 10/14-10/25
yeah

because whoOot so long

is it a Stanford reunion? lol the lab is gonna be so empty in October
Yup
Grace Hopper and Reunion
ok, so not counting on Pao visiting. Bernd and others still invited!
Cool!
When is good for you?

Tomorrow night?
sure, but remember I'm 3 hours behind you, so like around 10pm your time.. or I could do today or tomorrow my early morning (your 11am)
No it's fine
consider my last-minute tendency
ok, so tomorrow night!

later is better anyway

the talk is tuesday?
do you know that Pao will give a talk tomorrow afternoon in front of IIS?
I did not know that
Oh yeah
at 1pm PST
maybe before that is good because we already gave our feedback
oh I see in the calendar
#justSayin^^
haha
I might be able to join that, but will only know tomororw
okie
it depends on when Ece wants to brainstorm with me
If not later is fine
and it's kind of spontanous

alright 
I'll let you know tomorrow a couple of minutes before whether to connect me
okie
so bernd, I put in the calendar that you will visit on the weekend of oct 22 
wait so did you talk to anyone else or is it just me then?
just you for now, but we can invite your german friend
steve plans to move to seattle at some point
but not sure excatly when, maybe we should do the visit when he's also here
what about the weather? does it get colder there?^^
it's not too cold
it can rain
but that's the way it works here 
I also want to do a weekend in vancouver and a weekend in olympic national park (http://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm) , so if people come visit we could also do a big trip
oh, and joseph might be interested, but I think later in novemeber
but making a big trip removes the benefits of staying in your house
true.
joseph is not here until october 25
I think if we try to get everyone it will never happen 
people are not spontaneous enough
https://www.google.com/search?q=olympic+national+park&rlz=1C1CKMB_enUS498US498&espv=2&biw=1366&bih=667&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAWoVChMIjdy_782pyAIV1TSICh2HvwV-
the national park is actually 2-3 hours drive, so can be combined with staying at my place 
whoa it looks great. i know, people are not spontaneous at all

#observation Conversation might be off topic but it might make it easier for people to contribute more ideas than when they don't have a chat room to exchange ideas.
BTW I have $50 EMS reward that is going to expier on 10/31/2015
buy something!
Ping me if you think you will want something from there.

ok fine
buy something for youself..
@observation yep it seems a good thing that this is not structured at all
@observation and it seems to stuck people together more often.
#observation (elaborates your observations) perhaps also seeing that there is a lot #offtopic motivated people to contribute ideas and get discussion back on track? (#badguy)
#badguy or the system can give prompt people to be a bad guy
so Ill doublecheck if there is any schedule 22-25. 
in that case you don't have to feel as bad. 
@badguy but then people will hate badguy so people will hate the system. or not?!
yup pao, but need to do it in a way that does not discourage people from conversing even when it's offtopic
it's fine
yup
maybe not too often
and bernd, yup, let me know if the 22 (or something else) works out, would be awesome to have visitors, the aprtment is too big for me anyway
#competition. What if there is a competition between different chatrooms?
maybe only if the context is good 
#competition can be fun
@competition I like this quite a bit
hahaha
# or @?

and also it feels like procastination but it is actually productive (or not? #bummerrr)
#competition #combining ideas - finding embarrassing photos of your advisor (we win)
Yes
# is new, @ relates to previous #. somehow like that
oh, I totally didn't know that
sorry!
oops I have been using it wrong too
I usually associate # with topics and @ with people
ok whatever
funnily we are actually all chatting from our laptop right?^^
Yup
yup

it would be super annoying to type all this on mobile
It's easier to type here
I think mobile is for quick short ideas that came up right now
HUGE BUMMER

Maybe there is a less informal way to communicate in this way than chat.
Hm...
but mobile is good for these microtasks to structure the ideas
Or prompting people
and without this "mobile" we wouldnt have created this chat  so if it waas only for the sake of this creative chat its already good 
yeah, like "open your laptop"

yeah yeah, I agree mobile is good
just different types of discussions
perhaps less #offtopic 
cause barrier for typing is higher
but certainly reading ideas on the T
or whatever
taking picture of something cool that related to an idea
huh great hypothesis
hey Bernd, do you know Dan Bohus from MSR? he does cool work that in some way relates to things you're interested in. Potential internship mentor for the future(?) http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/dbohus/
#badGuy we could set a reminder if (number of ideas)/(total number of textmessages) gets too small 
ha, nice 
but the #badguy has to be fun
otherwise it's annoying
Yup
so, perhaps also needs to take into account context, and interrupt at appropriate time and not in the middle of a discussion
yeah, like "hey guys, you know what would be hilarious, discussing about christmas card headings"

maybe just showing this (number of ideas)/(total number of textmessages) ratio is already useful
#badguy #competition. Would you let Steven and Ken generate more ideas than you?
no way! 
#badguy #competition cool, so we create a social context by showing all the other team members number of ideas
#badguy #competition but not only quantity, also quality can be coded into a score by counting the branches in ideahound
yup, quality, diversity
though guessing it's hard
if we have the ideamap it can be measured easily

#ideasummary the workflow would be (raw idea chat) + (hashtagged ideas) + (microtasks) + (media recorded by mobile) -> ideamap -> scores on quantity and quality/diversity -> stimulates generating even more ideas
+1 for #summary
+1 for +1 
#+1

#goingtobrainstormwithmyselfideasforMSRproject
then visiting Katharina in a couple of hours!
thanks for the MSR link, its sounds very related.
is he also your boss? 
nope, but his work is super cool
i will check out his profile more but sounds really interesting
they have two new cool projects
one where they identify whether the person actually wants directions or just messes with the robot
and one where the robot tries to control the interaction, by telling people to come closer or move further based on its sensor needs
wow we should also create a chat for #MSRSelfdrivingCars 
will say hi!
+1 for bernd's idea

I'm going for a run to my homie Charles couldnt find any interesting event on this eventful hubweek
haha
have fun running!
catch you guys later
Bye!
there is no "bye" in this chat. it will be autodeleted xD 
#thought how does system support changes when we move from synchronous conversation to asynchronous ideation
#badGuy
haha
Awwww
#aloneMode?
good question, lets see
yeah, I ended up having a momologue yesterday 
#observation some of our ideas are concrete ideas, some of our thoughts bring up new questions to ideate about
yes, touching monolouge 
Yup
anyway, more later!
not bye!
Kk
not!
#bias what if this whole ideation works only so well here because we are outliers im terms of motivation. how can we test a prototype on someone else? :-O
#randomDoubts
I think you definitely need people with some motivation to contribute, but I think that happens when you have a real group of people
like my family used whatsapp to brainstorm ideas for gifts and birthday parties
I agree. And there is an opportunity here
Because people usually do one session and forget about it.
but to go into this dynamic we need to force people to use it first #chickenEggProblems
Having a constant (passive?) reminder might help them do more. (#hypothesis)
I think the chat idea is actually good beacuse it's low barrier
people use chat anyway
After people get into it. This sort of sticks (at least for me)
so potential to augment that seems promising to me
#observation I had this random thought and wanted to share it before I go running so I can see your guys response when I come back. secondly with this being on my phone, I wouldnt have opened my laptop.
weren't you going to go running an hour ago? 
#offtopic yes i still didnt go running xD
and like for your observation
yup but I was stuck with an email. Im really slow writing email :'-(
#relatedwork given the chat idea, I think worth looking into Barbara's work on modeling discourse. It might become relevant
hahaha
I just printed it out
what email do you need to write?

+1 for mild nudging #justLearnedAVocabulary :-P
#overview #summary And I think now I am itching to have a thing that allows me to see an overview of what we have talked about so far.

you printed the chat? haha nice
nonono
#thought what's the importance of social cues like smileys in this ideation process?
I print the paper
did you manage to download the chat?
*printed
I am thinking about doing that and put it is some available parser.
*in
very meta that we had a misunderstanding about the context of something in a dialogue related to you printing Barbara's paper on precisely those issues 

@Barbara will discuss that with her next week in our 1-1
ooh, you have 1-1 with her??
when?
SUPERMETA :D +1

i need the results of this chat tomorrow lunch badly. have a 1-1 with K. #iterateFast
the week after
Hm...
another context meta :D the week after is my meeting with Barabara
i think parsing is still doable by hand so far^^
You can see a quick history from your gmail.
Search for chat
need to head out to meet Katharina (she is german, I hear they are punctuate :))
will check back later!
im off too. later!
Me too
not bye!
have fun  with whatever you do
ice-cream is included in the plan so I'm happy

ttyl
hello!
#observation I guess ideatiom is also related to what resources ideators have (eg. knowledge, money, access to information, access to material etc.). i know, not a harvard problem, but thinking about how a group of ideators in rural india could benefit from such a tool would be probably worth to look at
#idea is the virtual agent (like the #badGuy) better when one human is selected or should it be AI based
#idea lets combine #learnOnWait with #microtasks and #monologue. if there is a monologue, the microtask pops up and it has two functions: (1) reminds ideator on previous random ideas (2) makes use of the time the ideator "waits" for others response. hypothesis: the ideators that are currently motivated dont have the frustrating monologue experience but can contribute to the ideation process as muvh as they want
#observation I definitely need to bring my phone next time I run 20kilometers. I forgot half of the ideas I had 

#experiment what is this and how does it relate to ideahound?
#observation when should someone be classified as idea "spammer". I think I'm close #selfBashing
#observation the texts/day plot will be interesting.
#hypothesis the more knowledge/intelligence/creativity the ideator has, the more he/she can get out of a co-located brainstorming session so the less he/she will benefit from a distributed ideation setting. in other words who needs this tool and who doesnt?
#researchQuestion Do groups with different level of diversity (the experience and knowledge of members) benefit more from co-located sessions or from asynchronous situation?
#scalability The tool will be useful regardless if it can scale.
#diversityTrumpsAbility
would be interesting if there is some literature behind #researchQuestion
scale in what terms? number of texts is too big but random discussion is still useful?
number of people
intereating. I suddenly forgot why ideamap needs to be scalable in this setting
guess I should read the paper again. sorry #dumbQuestion
???
let me clarify #dumbQuestionOnScalability. The previous design of ideahound was for organic ideation in the crowd. but now we look at small groups of ideators that could potentially meet in person and how ideahound could support their ideation, right? or in which context does an IM need to be scalable? sorry, yet another #dumbQuestion
ahhh
it can be different system or the same.
doesn't matter
It would be cool if it can scale
but we can start with a sizable group
but we can think of an approach like divide people into small conversation group as the number of users grow
etc.
my understanding of scalability is a systems ability to function at large scale (ie. with many users) at least with the same performance than at small scale, ie. with growing number of users it still works
hm interesting. I just totally forgot about the scalability aspect so far
#hypothesis more than 5 users perform better in subgroups because the group gets too diverse and therefore unproductive
but in our current setting that doesn't sound like its needed. definitely just thinking about #scalability makes me view the system yet from another perspective. I should definitely do some reading there, will look through ideahound paper for references on ideation at scale 😉 
can you recommend a paper there? but great, you just opened up a new branch in my ideamap on this chat^^
#branching!
yes, branching! 
there is SO MUCH literature out there... #lostInPublicationLists
Hahaha
Yeah
I need to update my list too
-___-
is there a research track at CHI on scalable creativity?
Nope
we are smaller than a subculture
but there are some studies on existing platform like Pinterest, 99u and what not
*99design
joy kim? is she working on this?
Hm not on a large scale I think
Although the writing project can be related
thats what i was looking at
Technology to support emergent literacy skills in young children with visual impairments
didnt seem to get beyond EA^^
#readingGroup haha how about showing randomly some past ideas that you had several years ago
#readingGroup is #keepingTrack related
whoa it took me soo long to sort the ideas and generate only this 1-D "Ideamap"
I shared it with you on Gdrive
but its only based on the hashtag text parts
and still its a big mess
Heading back from Katharina, 25min drive and then will catch up :-)
my favorite hypothesis so far: #hypothesis a distributed ideation tool such as a chat interface leads toeards creating more diverse ideas because I dont remember all the previous ideas

ok save drive, take care 
Back, read the thread :-)
I like the idea of reminding you of your old ideas. I sometimes get reminded of an old idea i had, and now actually have more ability to implement  it. It could be like the "memories" feature on FB
and Bernd, you run 20k??? #offtopic
About remote vs colocated. Sometimes you cant be colocated, like in my case :-(
and also -- you now have the mobile thing of I was just out and thinking of something, I don't have to wait to share it
CONCEPTUAL/RESEARCH QUESTIONS
How to handle different idea branches in mobile space? When are there enough branches and ideators should start “elaboration” ? How to detect this context?
How valuable is an offtopic discussion for diverse ideation?
How do other activities of ideators (eg. weekend trip) relate to the number of ideas generated
How do ideators keep track of ideas and when is keeping track good or bad?
Do groups with different level of diversity (the experience and knowledge of members) benefit more from co-located sessions or from asynchronous situation?

SYSTEM
microtask replaces unlock “does this idea relate more to A or B”. this feature could be context-aware
picturetaking: when at new place, ask to take photo and explanation how this could relate to idea
wait-microtask: when I text new idea and no direct discussion is going on, a microtask pops up
microtask after wakeup / to stop alarmclock
overview of core branches from ideamap also shown in mobile app
gamification: show “number of ideas” of other team to give motivation for generating more ideas continuously
BadGuy: detect too much offtopic discussion and lead back to topic with funny way or “state how this relates to the ideation topic”

RELATED WORK
Barbara's work on modeling discourse
#timeToElaborate #noMoreDiverseIdeas #findConceptualQuestions
I wont fit to AAAI Symposium, its meant to be for more senior researchers, so I wont apply for it
oh and when I told K that @Ofra is in this chat, he said "Poor her" 
haha
is Pao senior enough?
as the organizer of the symposium, I wasn't aware that that's a criteria (I can see the rationale, but some fresh minds might be good)
seenior means wrote at least 5 papers that can be used to draw a more overall conclusion
^^
I think another argument is that the project isnt far enough
interesting. I barely qualify for my own symposium then
yeah, the project is new but it can be more about challenges. anyway, that's fine
but good you brought up the symp with him cause he's been ignoring a somewhat urgent email from me, maybe it will remind him 
yeah should be fine
haha ok Ill try to remind him as many times as possible. like at Pao's practice talk 
haha 
back to #ontopic, I like all the questions you raised so far
oh it wasnt me... it was the organic crowd 

its simply an extraction of thoughts
#idea here's another possible not-so-micro task: can the system recommend ideators to turn to look at the literature when there are already a few branches 
a lot of times ideation benefits from reflection on what has been done
like we brought up the Barbara paper
so maybe a prompt can be: find a work that's related to idea X
+1 for your #idea
underlying research question whether introducing this features leads to design fixation
possibly, so maybe you could also encourage people to find related work from diverse fields
to get multiple perspectives
also interesting if people would do the #relatedWorkMicrotask rather on the phone or on the PC
good point. I would be that it's more suitable for PC if you actually need to do search, and can be mobile if it just prompts you to think about works you already know about
like I could do it on the T if it's simply recovering things from memory
but if I need serious google scholaring, probably PC
thats a great microtask
#relatedWork (not obvious connection, but maybe): "Toward a Theory of Situation Awareness in Dynamic Systems" http://uwf.edu/skass/documents/HF.37.1995-Endsley-Theory.pdf
they talk about how our awareness of a situation affects our ability to solve problems etc.
I wonder if there's some sense of maintaining awareness about the global ideation process can lead to better ideation
#hand_waving
#thought (inspired by real events) how do you handle biased ideation? just as a hypothetical example that may or may not be my current situation at MSR: assume there are 3 people ideating, and there are currently three branches. Each of the three people has a different preference over which direction to pursue, but still wants to be helpful in ideating the other branches in case they are chosen
#probably_out_of_scope
interesting. Im currently walking Ill text soon
sick?
oh, I misread your message 
I read Ill as Ill (sick) and not I'll, because I didn't notice the "walking"
oops
haha not sick 

yeah, your #thought actually might even get worse the more focuesed one's intersts are
so how you gonna convince them your idea is best? 
haha, I might not, because I should also optimize for my mentor excitement potentially
but it's funny, cause Eric Horvitz (who's a big shot) is actually most interested in the direction that I like most
but Ece is not excited about it
we'll see
ERIC HORVITZ!!!!!!!
haha
wow I wanna meet him. he makes so intersting stuff!!!
whoaa
yup, he was present in our first brainstorming session
he will be involved to some degree
he's also involved with that person that does robots that I shared with you yesterday
so another reason for you to come here 
omfg I really wanna talk with him
haha
MSR seems to be the place to be^^
it's not bad 
maybe I need to catch him one on one
and then he would make Ece excited about our ideas
but he's like the busiest person in the world
we are so #offtopic
sorry
so how was that when he joined brainstorming, is there anything we should integrate from his skils into ideahound? :D
no, he's actually quite not focused
he is diverse though
branches out
and then gets reminded of something
that relates to the hypothesis that people's background has a strong effect
he knows about so many different things that everything reminds him of some project
thats great. yeah I guess #experience is valuable for diverse ideation. I wonder how #diversityBeatsExpertise applies in this situation
depends on how you define expertise, I think
if you are expert in something specific
you are at risk of fixation
that inspires me to integrate more #crazy ideas into our project
but someone like Eric might be in less danger
I'm all up for #crazy 
though he does have the bias of taking everything to decision-theory at the end 
"how to kill someone with a self driving car"
xD
haha
nobody's perfect 
true.
#question how to stimulate crazy thoughts
hmm, good #question
#hypothesis if people are in life danger, they have crazy ideas
maybe #hypothesis is hard to test though^^
haha
good luck with getting IRB!
we asked 15 users in a life endangering situation to fill out our questionnair 
#crazy thoughts require removing constraints
so perhaps system can help identify what assumption we are making
and then we can remove them
and get crazier
#fuckIRB 
haha
well I can see some pattern in your ideas
#roleplaying... What kind of ideas would a _____ come up with
?
i'll try: @Ofra #AI #automize #planning #nlp
haha ok ill flip #roleplaying around. what kind of role are we currently in, in this chat
And I did roleplaying with my grandmother. MORE CRAZY!!!

what???
I like role-playing
what ideas would Bernd's grandmother would come up with?

#berndsgrandmotheridea Can I make the text size bigger? 
haha
#question whats the most crazy situation where people have a smartphone with them? And how can we make them use ideahound in that situation because theres gonna come a crazy idea out of it 
the obvious one is drunk people
but you could combine context in #role-playing. for example, you were just in ML class, so role-playing might be "what would an ML expert suggest?"
thats a deeper social problem. people here dont live "crazy" so they get drunk to experience something they can call "crazy"
very deep, Bernd!
how deep exactly?
about society and stuff
#idea people in the us always stand in line
can we have people ask people next to them in line for ideas
?

awesome ide
a
with respect to biased ideation that I brought up earlier, I'm now trying to think: instead of convincing them to go my way, can I make my idea in some way close to their ideas, so that we can compromise and all like it(?)
#question can we detect if someone is nearby that can answer my question
maybe. I think there are some works about expert finding
#question can we detect if someone is nearby that has a creative idea
but usually within a cooperation or in Q&A sites
cooperation = corporation!
#joggersAtMemorialDrive Can we just stand at Memorial Drive and ask every jogger for an idea?
haha
#stinkyIdation
#grandmother I have to explain every idea I have to my grandmother before I text it, if she is not an AI/HCI expert, its gonna be easy formulated

#biasedIdeation good idea, I guess it will be all related?
yeah, but it's tricky. will see what I can pull off 
#question would you take a "risk" in your internship (e.g., rely on using a driving simulator), or would you go "safe"?
#answer well research can always fail I guess. K taught me today that 50% chance of success is high
is there a 50% chance you get the simulator?
hmm, maybe less. cause it's getting it going and working on time while I'm still here, which would introduce dependencies on other people who are not me
and 50% is high for research.
(agree with K)
I sort of have a plan b for simulator
it's just less convincing experimentally
what...experiments with your MSR car? 
(I'm #offtopic again :))
haha, no
doing a game environment, with a person and an agent
instead of really simulating driving
you could "simulate" a self driving by driving your partiipants around and acting like a self driving car 
haha
the transfer of control might be tricky
thats true
but I like the way you think 
#offtopic I forgot the time and my volleyball training is already going on for 30min. will be there earliest in 30 min, so I have 30 min practice. should I still go?
#damn
hmm
bummer, hope it's not my fault you forgot with the discussions here
why should it take you 30 min to get there
just take the bike and leave 
ill have to change and all that stuff. you guys should join me, then there is more #groupDynamics
I would join you when I'm back
anyway, don't know if 30min is worth it, but you know how the practice is..
they usually play in teams the last 30 min. doesnt really make sense
ill practice a little in the office 
haha
dont tell K 

I should head home
catch you later..
#measureValueOfIdeaByTime. The research question here is whether the amount of time/discussion people put into an idea can signify its quality.

#measureValueOfIdeaByTime good question. 
#question how does excitement about ideation task evolve in an asynchronous, distributed ideation task
#affect do people get again more excited if they are prompted to elaborate on already generated ideas because the project then gets more concrete?
I like #measureValueOfIDByTime
but need to be careful that idea was not forgotten by mistake
so you could occasionally "push" it to see if people pick up on it
our readinggroup discussion about getting many citations through writing a methods paper led me to these new questions
#ideadatabase What kind of idea databases exist that we can use to train an ideation process model? If not at what kind of studies is there actually a need for such a dataset? And can we provide it after our study?
#method How ca we actually evaluate ideation tools best? Whats  common and what could we improve about it?
#survey What is the state of the art with ideation tools? What are different current approaches that could be compared in a survey?
#researchIdeationTool how can ideahound be applied in our community's research? #hypothesis HCI research benefits using ideahound in the innovation process
#ideaStorm ;)
will think and react a little later, just wanted to note that just as you were having this ideaStorm I had sort of one of my own for the project here while ideating with myself
@bernd you should stop procrastinating ML HW
Seems like that was a bright moment :-D
thanks for #badGuy
at least ideation is a form of#positiveProcrastination
@ofra looking forward to hraring your ideation progress
will share once it's slightly less vague!
#procrastination how does procrastination affect ideation?
today so far I'm ideating by myself, which makes me think that another question is how to identify points when it's beneficial for the group to not communicate for a while (like if I identify you are in an ideastorm maybe I should not interrupt you)
more specifically, we know that there is research that says that in general it's better for people to first come up with their own ideas and only then share with the group. But the question is, in #long-term idation scenarios, when should transitions between group work and individual work should be initiated
when should we nudge the group toward one or the other. and also, maybe related is when do we nudge the group to transition from divergent to convergent and vice versa if it's a long-term ideation and not just one cycle
#monolouge-over
I like #procrastination and #isolatedChamber
Not that I like procrastination
...
oh well, you guys know what I meant

While you are procrastinating might be a good opportunities to get a mixture of ideas.
just a second will send your "i like procrastination" to K 
....
*not serious*
hahahahaha
I was thinking exactly the same. I will put it on my agenda for my next meeting with K.
*kiddingggg
haha
very funny
-*-
i hear you laughing Pao^^
nope
in any case K is not responding to my emails lately so probably no danger if I send him your procrastination quote 
#question is there a different ideation outcome if people are texting with each other while sitting in the same room than when they are actually talking? :-D
aw
it's ok, I nudged him on hipChat for the thing that was urgent
and then he did it 
@ofra yeah he said he doesnt like you anymore ;-)
hahahaha
thanks bernd!
anytime! :-P
@bernd, did you finish your ml assignment? 
-whisper- no he hasn't
haha
no
and currently I am watching a youtube video about how to make paper prototypes

go back to your homework! #badguy
I have mixed feelings about this assignment
why mixed?
don't you just hate it?
no they are actually gaussian mixed 
#geekalarm
haha
is there a nice music on youtube that fits with an ML assignment?
happy about any recommendations

ooh, that's hard, I don't know your music style
you know...that puts me into the right mood 
do you want upbit or quiet?
upbeat
no idea
ok, I'll try a few things to see what your model is
wait Im curious which prior you have

good luck!
Bernd hat den Hangout umbenannt in Ideahound.
#bernd get to work! don't find hound pictures!
don't type! get to work!
actually I think in the community they would prefer Ideacat
or even Ideakitten

haha
for K: IteaHound

+1 for Iteahound
Iteation
createavity
like createavity!
And go back to your HW really
createavity!
@pao, when you write your plan or when you write emails to K, always write createavity and see when he notices
ooh
I will try that
teanure 

teanure track! brilliant
when he gets tenure we have to get him a teanure mug..
#question how does assignment procrastination affect creative thinking
Hahaha
Ill order one now so he is more motivated #panicking
moteavated, sorry

you mean createave teanking
haha
@bernd
get to work
or I'll send sebstean to call you

ok ill work now
!
wow it is finally happening
haha, don't count on it
how about a mug label "I got teanure and I like it quite a bit"
ok i go back to work 
that's good , we'll save it for the announcement 
#"I got teanure and I like it quite a bit" Like!!!
I got teanure, now I can finally drink my tea!
though bernd's is better
we have some more time to elaborate on this branch of idea
yes, but not today for you!
go do hw!!!!
hahaha
he will love teanure, so don't reveal the idea until it's relevant
http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00V2BEIIG/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=D9LTDF3DZJ2Y&coliid=IJHGWV6FXUS8K&psc=1
if he doesn't get it we can always get him a mug "I spent too much time drinking tea and now I didn't get teanure"
awwwww
#badguy
yeah good idea.
@bernd go away!!! 
maybe @pao and I should also go away
and then you will be less tempted
fine
ok
I should pack up anyway
finish your HW @bernd?
nope still stuck:-)

will not interrupt then
ill have to finish tomorrow, now I dont want to work on it anymore :-/
but isn't it due today?
yeah but there are latedays
oh ok
Im anyways already over midnight^^
is it super long or did they get more reasonable?
true
no its ok its actually interesting the programming part, it helps understanding the concept from a practical perspective I guess thats what the assigment is supposed to do, if there werent all these papers that I wanna read also :-D
haha 
so are you done with ideating?
for today, yes
but not generally
we want to finalize project by the end of the week
will see what we come up with tomorrow, it's a bit frustrating at times
but I already got some ideas that I like out of it so even if we don't end up doing them, I can work on them later on my own
but you should go to sleep 
I can tell you more tomorrow
will do a voice whatsapp message update
#timePressure is time pressure good or bad for ideation?
(probably not a clear cut answer)
I prefer taking a deep dive without pressure
->personality dependent
I also prefer that, but maybe sometimes time pressure is good to induce convergent thinking?
#offtopic question: how stupid of me would it be to suggest that I do both the project I like and the project my mentor likes? (too ambitious??)
hmm i guess it depends how related they are, I dont know its up to you. I just know that at the moment because of my classes, class projects, this stupid assignment and reading group i barely finish anything. So I'd prefer working on one. But you are in a completely different setting so its up to you. and dont forget to enjoy seattle 
yeah yeah, I should probably just do one 
but maybe if that one works really fast 
although, sometimes it's better to have two than one because when you are stuck on one  you make progress on the other..
anyway, probably start with one and see..
so did you "converge"?
we didn't meet yet, I was only thinking by myself so far..
btw, I relate to your pain of not doing anything, classes are so stuck when you want to do research
yep, its a pain in the a**
haha
is the mit class fun at least?
yep its more about reading and a project
its more research focused
good
that's the classes I like
cool article that describes in an easy way how incubation works, that means how to make our creative parts of the brain active
https://blog.bufferapp.com/why-we-have-our-best-ideas-in-the-shower-the-science-of-creativity
cool
if you guys feel bored, you can read my project ideas https://www.dropbox.com/s/fd1glupa13n5v9e/projectIdeas.pdf?dl=0
but just realized it's 1am
@bernd go to sleep
we had a new idea
?
everytime you come up with an idea "on the go" and dont wanna type it, immediately just write either the hashtag for the idea or take a photo of something nearby that might relate. its interesting to see the effect of what that guess stimulates ideas in others and how the guessing affects the original ideator
cool

haha

#idea trigger
See if you can guess what my idea is about from my awesome sketch
#myIdea I was wondering how orange juice can affect creativity
^^
very explicit 
should I reveal mine?

killing time?

no, it was actually the following: what is the appropriate time to kill an idea?
this came up yesterday when we brainstormed
we had to go through some infeasible ideas to reach something interesting
but if we kill the infeasible things immediately, we will block the path to good ideas
yeah, like not the tenthousandth social media study
haha
the advantage of a chat is killing ideas is harder because they are written down
yup
but luckily you didnt kill your ideas although you talk with your co-workers in real life

haha, we were actually saying that it was good it was just two of us yesterday without the most critical one, because then we killed ideas more slowly 
but maybe in two hours when we meet he kills them again 

oh, social fridya
say hi to people
#askcreativequestions
it would be funny if you raise your hand, and then you ask him a riddle
or ask him if he can help with your ML exercise 
i was thinking if we could build a tool to support coming up with creative questions in a town hall meeting 
but you already guessed it 

I had background knowledge of your context 
yep thats true, but it could have been completely different. like does coke stimulate creative thinking

but you wrote #askcreativequestions 
how's the meeting? anything interesting?
oh yeah i forgot xFD
hm not really. the movement should happen 2019 Fall, thats the most intersting and the only one I remember
xD
I won't be at Harvard by then 
#cognitiveLoad There are some empirical evidence that seeing stimuli affects you differently depending on your current cognitive load.
If the cognitive load is already high, the stimuli are just annoying.
However, if your cognitive load is not too high, the stimuli can prompt you to think about new things and make new connection (it helps you become more creative).
So far, we don't have a way to detecting how much cognitive load you have yet.  
However, is it possible to detect cognitive load through other more measurable thing like affects and  activities?
If we can do so, it will not only be useful for creative literature but important in other field as well.
Note from what I was talking with K earlier today.
He also gives us a pointer. http://www.affectiva.com/
for example: http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/papers/chi11.solovey.pdf
But the process is rather intrusive
(not in a let's poke a stick in a brain kind of way but you have to wear a funny headgear)
You now have meetings over the weekend with K? :-)
ahh I just saw him in the hallway
He is meeting w/ Ken
Ha :-)
Here is related work on creativity side.
http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/17467526/WIRUCHNIPAWAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf?sequence=1
My friend's thesis. It is not super concrete because she comes from a business/econ background.
But maybe a good source for citations. 
Im looking for indirect measures of cognitive load. like this boreApp that detects boredom
http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sjunikim/publications/UBICOMP2010_Cognitive_Load.pdf
(cognitive load)
#hypothesis: prompting people at randomly selected times (eg. 2x per day) instead of letting them sit down and brainstorm leads to more ideas because (1) they are in a random, possibly inspiring context, and (2) when the prompt includes previous ideas from other brainstormers, the combination of their context + diverse set of ideas leads to even more diverse idea sets than the ones shown in the ideahound paper
the #hypothesis experiment would lead to a new #question if there is an #optimalTime for prompting users but I guess the randomness would also already show interesting results
#question how to come up with a good hci research question? not sure if our experiment would answer that question but it would be interesting to see many HCI researchers using #mobileIdeaHound for coming up with research ideas 
#randomIdea
#IwantToWriteAMethodologyPaper

#offtopic there's a guy across from my office who's always on skype and always loud. Remind you of someone? 
#ontopic  we've been idle for more than a day, should the system have prompted us to do something
I started with an #offtopic to just get people's attention to the chat again 
#hypothesis a creativity chat stops when we are out of ideas
or we just got busy
how can you re-engage us 
?
#question is it necessary for good ideas that we always and continuously discuss them?
#question what are the characteristics of a mobile distribution group ideation collaboration?
#question how does physical distribution of collaboration members affect the engagement of individual ideators?
what should I discuss with K today about Ideahound? #ideas?^^
Maybe pick one or two of the ideas/hypotheses that you are most interested in and try to dig deeper on them together?
the thing is i didnt have time last week to work on it
so it actually doesnt make sense to discuss now about it^^
anyway ill come up with something :-P
Oh I see
You can tell him you had courses stuff etc..
But think whether you want his advice about any of the directions you are thinking about
ok
oh and we will discuss your CHI paper :-)
:-)
You know , we first tried to submit it to cscw
And K was super happy about it, he was like "i can imagine us getting best paper"
And then it was rejected :-)
But I guess it turned out for the best
oh I didn't know that
it got rejected?!
yup, from cscw
I guess your cscw bashing was too explicit :PP
then we revised it significantly
did you already have your meeting with K?
yep
we talked about what the value of an empirical study in hci is and what the exact contribution of your awesome paper is :)
oh
now I'm curious 
because I was saying "well the model seems valid in the experiment case but how does it apply to health or other settings in general, and also how does that model help to solve the problems that you identified such as identifying when to share what with whom (I was just trying to argue you know, not downgrading your work). and he was like "how can you say that, you didnt understand the paper blah blah. was quite fun. so the conclusion was I should read the multi agent modeling part again because he thinks I didnt understand that part. and we will also read sunyoungs apparently similar paper in terms of the approach. and then we discuss next time the value and contribution of empirical papers like yours again. so far the summary of our discussion, was really interesting :)
haha 
sounds fu
he had a meeting with sunyoung after our meeting but we kept arguing for like 20 more minutes and sunyoung was just watching us :D
cool 
she didn't intervene in the argument? 
nope ;)
did you also get to talk about the chat project or just about papers?
nope, there was no time :(
sorry my paper was so controversial 

haha :D
speaking of our own projects, how is yours going?
good question
I'm trying to finalize details of a few different ways in which to decide when a "teacher" agent should help a "student" agent
and then I'm supposed to tell Ece and Andrey when I'm ready to share with them something more concrete
so trying to see if I can do it today
or just tomorrow
it's a bit challenging cause I don't yet have good intuitions for reinforcement learning
but hopefully will be fine
sounds cool, so the problem is a decision problem (sharing or not) that you wanna solve with reinforcement learning?
sounds challenging
not excatly. the problem is a learning problem -- we want the student agent to learn to act well as fast as possible
we have a teacher available
but say that there's some cost to using the teacher
the question is when should we use the teacher -- who should decide (teacher or student) and what information should be shared with the teacher so that it can teach
and how the student can use the teacher's demonstration to learn
so the information sharing angle is more about what information is shared between the teacher and student and when
in order to make teaching effective
sounds relevant for your thesis as well. cool!
I think I convinced Barbara that it's relevant 
a bit of a stretch but worked I think
thats good!
I just hope we will be able to get some interesting results
as you know, a lot of research projects fail 
would be cool to have a predictor for that
totally!
but that would also remove the excitement :P
haha
just an interesting thought I wanna share, from an internet.org talk i attended yesterday. people in developing countries sometimes wait several minutes until their message was sent or a website finished loading. while we would stop waiting after seconds. thats how inpatient we are :-) reading papers like #waitLearning seems ridiculous in having this fact in mind :-D
